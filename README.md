# Advent of jq
Solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles in
[`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

Generally there are two scripts per day: `a.jq` is the solution to
part 1 of the puzzle, `b.jq` the solution to part 2. The scripts are
executable and read the puzzle input from `STDIN`:

```
./a.jq < sample.txt
```
